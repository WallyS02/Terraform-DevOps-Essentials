# Terraform DevOps Essentials
## If I'll find any other feature to be useful - it'll surely be added!
## Infrastructure as Code \(IaC\)
IaC is a practice of managing infrastructure \(servers, networks, databases, etc.\) through code rather than manual operations. The infrastructure is defined in configuration files that can be versioned, tested, and automated. It keeps infrastructure consistent in every environment \(e.g. dev, test, prod\), allows teams to collaborate with code rather than manual operations and supports idempotency - infrastructure stays the same after running code multiple times \(no unwanted changes\).

Terraform is an open-source tool by HashiCorp that allows for implementing IaC practise with declarative approach \(code describes what you want to achieve, not how you want to achieve it\). It supports many platforms \(e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes\), allows for proficient teamwork by sharing infrastructure state, carefully describes infrastructure changes when applying new version and allows for modular architecture by reusable components.
## How it works?
Basicly - write a configuration file \(.tf\) and run appropriate commands to apply your infrastructure! How to do it? See below.
